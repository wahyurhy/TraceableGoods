## Design and Develop an Android-Based Food Distribution Traceability System to Support E-Government in The Department of Trade
The distribution of food commodities plays a crucial role in meeting the food needs of the wider community and serves as the link between food producers and end consumers through a complex food supply chain. Without clear and transparent food distribution, there can be negative consequences that may endanger food security and public health, leading to issues like food crises and economic losses. Based on this background, this research aims to design a mobile application based on the Android platform that can record the traceability of food distribution, ensuring transparency, and potentially bringing positive impacts to the community. The methodology used involves the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) framework, implementing Agile methodology to provide flexibility and adaptability during the application development process. The application is built using the Kotlin programming language, and Android Studio serves as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The outcome of this research is a system in the form of an Android-based application for recording the traceability of food distribution. Through beta testing, the application has been directly tested by a group of users, and the results indicate that the application meets user expectations and fulfills their needs, as assessed through the evaluation methods used.
